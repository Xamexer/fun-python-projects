# fun-python-projects

This repository is a collection of small experiments and playful projects I’ve built while exploring Python.
The focus is not on a structured learning path, but rather on trying out ideas, having fun, and creating little applications along the way.

Examples of what you’ll find here:

* Mini Games: e.g. Mastermind and other simple interactive games.
* Generators and Simulations: like a small physics generator.
* Playful Experiments: random ideas that helped me practice and explore Python in creative ways.

This repo is less about polished products and more about tinkering, experimenting, and enjoying what’s possible with Python.
